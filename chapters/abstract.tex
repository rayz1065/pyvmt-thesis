Formal verification has become an essential tool in ensuring safety and liveness of complex software and hardware systems that are used in safety critical situations.
Over the last few years symbolic methods for formal verification have become quite popular, and the definition of the standard language \smtlib{} has led to the creation of a large collection of benchmarks.
This allowed for comparisons between \smt{} solvers which further sparked innovation.
Another contributor is \pysmt{}, a \python{} library that makes working with \smt{} problems simple, and offers tools for formula manipulation which don't rely on any specific solver.
This thesis goal is to contribute to the field of \VMT{} by extending \pysmt{} with the creation of \pyvmt{}, a library that includes specific tools used in verification, allowing for faster prototyping of models and algorithms, and increasing the interoperability of model checkers.
I will be going over the architecture of the library, the ways it allows to run model checkers within the library and how it interfaces with external tools.
I will also be presenting the results from an experimental evaluation, showing how the implementations of two \ltl{} encoding procedures compare to each other as a proof of concept for the capabilities of the library.
