\chapter{Verification modulo theory}

Satisfiability modulo theory is a generalization of the SAT (boolean satisfiability) problem, it involves proving whether a formula can be satisfied by some assignment of the variables. The expressions which can include lists, arrays, bit vectors, and strings are interpreted within a formal theory. There exists a standard language for defining SMT problems called SMT-LIB \cite{SMT-LIB} and it allows simpler interfacing to the solvers, which are the programs developed to decide whether a formula is satisfiable.

Verification modulo theory adds to that the verification of transition systems.

\section{The VMT-LIB format}
VMT-LIB is an extension of the SMT2 format and provides a standard interface for defining transition systems by exploiting the possibility to attach annotations to terms and formulas, which can be used to specify the model behaviors. \cite{VMT-LIB}

It is designed with a limited amount of language constructs, aiming for simplicity for anyone interested in implementing the language within their VMT solver:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{:next name} is used to specify state variables. To define a state variable, two variables are created, one representing the current state and one representing the next state. The next annotation is used to link the next state variable to the current state variable.
    \item \textbf{:init} is used to specify the formula used to constrain the initial states for the system.
    \item \textbf{:trans} is used to specify the formula used to constrain the transitions from each state to the next for the system.
    \item \textbf{:invar-property idx} is used to specify an invariant property to be verified, in LTL it's in the form \begin{math} G (f) \end{math} and requires a formula to always hold.  A unique non-negative integer specifies the index of the property.
    \item \textbf{:live-property idx} is used to specify a live property to be verified, in LTL it's in the form \begin{math} F (G (f))\end{math} and requires a formula to hold infinitely often. A unique non-negative integer specifies the index of the property.
